For Quant:

1. Probability & Combinatorics (The Interview Core)
18.05 Introduction to Probability and Statistics: This is arguably the most important starting point. It covers basic combinatorics, Bayesian inference, and probability distributions with a focus on intuition rather than just theory.

18.440 Probability and Random Variables: A more rigorous follow-up that dives into discrete and continuous random variables, laws of large numbers, and central limit theorems—essential for "expected value" thinking.

2. Linear Algebra & Advanced Theory
18.06 Linear Algebra: Taught by the legendary Gilbert Strang, this course is vital for understanding eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and SVD, which are the backbone of the statistical modeling used at Gravitron.

18.445 Introduction to Stochastic Processes: Crucial for options-heavy firms like Optiver. It covers Markov chains, random walks, and martingales—the literal "math of gambling" and market movements.

3. Quantitative Finance Applications
18.642 Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance: This course is specifically designed for this career path. It features lectures from industry professionals and covers portfolio valuation, arbitrage, and the Black-Scholes model.

15.450 Analytics of Finance: Focuses on the "how-to" of quantitative methods, including Monte Carlo simulations and Itô calculus, which are heavily used in proprietary trading desk roles.

4. Statistical Modeling & Signal Processing
18.443 Statistics for Applications: Provides the statistical inference tools needed to turn raw market data into "signals."

To transition from a general math background to the level required by Jane Street or Optiver, you should follow a "bottom-up" approach. You must first master the speed of basic operations before moving into the abstract world of stochastic calculus.

Here is the recommended order of study, incorporating the calculus foundations you requested.

---

## Phase 1: The Foundations (Calculus & Linear Algebra)

Before tackling probability, you need the tools to manipulate continuous functions and multi-dimensional data.

1. **[18.01 Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/):** Focus on integration techniques and Taylor series. In trading, you often approximate complex functions using Taylor expansions.
2. **[18.02 Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/):** Essential for understanding joint probability distributions. You must be comfortable with partial derivatives and double integrals.
3. **[18.06 Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/):** Focus on Matrix Decomposition (SVD/PCA). This is how firms like Gravitron compress massive amounts of market data into tradable signals.

## Phase 2: Probability & Discrete Math (The "Trading" Core)

This is where the majority of Jane Street/Optiver interview questions live.

4. **[18.05 Introduction to Probability and Statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2022/):** Your first deep dive into Bayes' Theorem and expected value.
5. **[6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/):** Skip to the **Combinatorics** and **Graph Theory** sections. This helps with the logic puzzles and counting problems common in "brainteaser" rounds.

---

## Phase 3: Stochastic Systems (The "Quant" Core)

Once you understand static probability, you must learn how things change over time (Random Walks).

6. **[18.445 Introduction to Stochastic Processes](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-445-introduction-to-stochastic-processes-spring-2015/):** This covers Markov Chains and Martingales. If you don't understand Martingales, you cannot pass a senior-level trading interview.
7. **[18.642 Mathematics with Applications in Finance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-642-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2024/):** The "capstone" course that ties calculus and probability together to price options and manage risk.

## Where to Practice (Daily Drill)

To succeed, you need to supplement these courses with active, timed practice.

### For Mental Math & Speed

* **[Zetamac (Arithmetic)](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/):** The industry standard for speed drills. Set the timer to 120 seconds and aim for a score above 50 (for starters) to 80 (for elite).
* **[Tradermath.org](https://www.tradermath.org/):** Specifically designed to mimic the Optiver and Flow Traders entrance exams (number series, fractions, etc.).

### For Probability Puzzles

* **[Brainstellar](https://brainstellar.com/):** A massive collection of quant riddles categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Deadliest).
* **[QuantGuide](https://www.quantguide.io/):** A platform that offers interview-style questions specifically tailored to firms like Jane Street and Citadel.

### For Theory & "The Green Book"

* **[Xinfeng Zhou’s "Green Book"](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662):** Work through this book cover-to-cover while taking the OCW courses. If you can solve every problem in this book, you are technically ready for a Quant Researcher interview.
