For Quant:

1. Probability & Combinatorics (The Interview Core)
18.05 Introduction to Probability and Statistics: This is arguably the most important starting point. It covers basic combinatorics, Bayesian inference, and probability distributions with a focus on intuition rather than just theory.

18.440 Probability and Random Variables: A more rigorous follow-up that dives into discrete and continuous random variables, laws of large numbers, and central limit theorems—essential for "expected value" thinking.

2. Linear Algebra & Advanced Theory
18.06 Linear Algebra: Taught by the legendary Gilbert Strang, this course is vital for understanding eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and SVD, which are the backbone of the statistical modeling used at Gravitron.

18.445 Introduction to Stochastic Processes: Crucial for options-heavy firms like Optiver. It covers Markov chains, random walks, and martingales—the literal "math of gambling" and market movements.

3. Quantitative Finance Applications
18.642 Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance: This course is specifically designed for this career path. It features lectures from industry professionals and covers portfolio valuation, arbitrage, and the Black-Scholes model.

15.450 Analytics of Finance: Focuses on the "how-to" of quantitative methods, including Monte Carlo simulations and Itô calculus, which are heavily used in proprietary trading desk roles.

4. Statistical Modeling & Signal Processing
18.443 Statistics for Applications: Provides the statistical inference tools needed to turn raw market data into "signals."
